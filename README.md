# CTEC3451-Cryptography-Project

## Assignment
My final year of study at university required me to undertake an independent development project, under the supervision of a member of staff.

For my project, I chose to create a system that could enhance the security of two users wishing to communicate on an unsecured channel. With the knowledge acquired throughout my academic studies, I developed a system that implemented modern cryptographic protocols to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user communication. This project investigated the ways in which communication can be secured on unsecured networks, such as the internet, and successfully developed a solution which could increase the security of user's network communication.

Once the project was complete, a working system was produced, and the development documentation was consolidated into a final report.

## Skills Developed
To complete this project, I had to learn how to manage an agile development project and test and document software iterations consistently. This project greatly challenged my resilience and ability to work alone. However, upon completion, I have gained the knowledge and confidence to undertake a new project of this scale on my own. This opportunity notably enhanced my proficiency in Python, teaching me how to use open-source libraries, introducing me to employing sockets for communication, and developing my clean coding practices.
